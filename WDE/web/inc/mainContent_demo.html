                        The Weather Data Environment (WxDE) is a research project that collects and shares transportation-related 
                        weather data with a particular focus on weather data related to connected vehicle applications. The WxDE collects data in real time 
                        from both fixed environmental sensor stations and mobile sources. The WxDE computes value-added enhancements to this data, such as by 
                        computing quality-check values for observed data and computing inferred weather parameters from vehicle data (e.g., inferring 
                        precipitation based on windshield wiper activation). The WxDE archives both collected and computed data. The WxDE supports 
                        subscriptions for access to real-time data in near real time generated by individual weather-related connected vehicle projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The WxDE is a weather-specific adjunct to the Data Capture and Management (DCM) Research Data Exchange and, as such, is used to provide 
                        weather data-related services that support the development, testing, and demonstration of multi-modal transportation mobility 
                        applications being pursued under the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
                        Dynamic Mobility Applications (DMA) program and other connected vehicle research 
                        activities. Data accessible through the WxDE will be well-documented and freely available to the public. Registration and approval 
                        may be required to access some data, if the original provider of the data places restrictions on its distribution by the WxDE. The 
                        vision of the DCM program is to enhance current operational practices and transform future transportation systems management through 
                        the active acquisition and systematic provision of integrated data from infrastructure, vehicles, and travelers. The data are 
                        available to researchers, application developers, and others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most information is available to all site visitors. Registered users are provided with some additional capabilities, such as creating 
                        data subscriptions and accessing data for which the original provider placed restrictions on its distribution by the WxDE.
