			Some contributor sites show only metadata as gray circles on the map, indicating that data are not available for public display.
			There are a few possible reasons for this, but it may be that the contributor has not yet signed a data sharing agreement.
			We encourage all states and other weather data contributors to sign such an agreement in order to provide a richer database
			to our research community.
